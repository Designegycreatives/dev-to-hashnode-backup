## Data Mining And SQL Practice PDFs

There is a good reason I had to quit blogging about each chapters of these **PDFs**

**First reason** is because, I want to focus more on developing my tech start up **Pink Data Hub**

**Second Reason** I just feel it would be better to share the entire book than just a piece of chapter weekly

So I decided to save the **PDFs** to my google drive
