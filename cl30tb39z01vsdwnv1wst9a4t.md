## Association Rule With Rapid Miner

**Roger** is a city manager for a medium-sized, but steadily growing city. The city has limited resources, and like most municipalities, there are more needs than there are resources.

He feels like the citizens in the community are fairly active in various community organizations, and believes that he may be able to get a number of groups to work together to meet some of the needs in the community.

He decides that before he can begin asking community organizations to begin working together and to accept responsibility for projects, he needs to find out if there are any existing associations between the different types of groups in the area.

**Association Rules** are data mining methodology that seeks to find frequent connections between attributes in a data set.
