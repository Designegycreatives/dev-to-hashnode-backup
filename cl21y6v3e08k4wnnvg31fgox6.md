## Data Cleaning Web App For Data Analysis

I am super excited i built something that can  be useful to me

I joined several data challenge on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anuoluwapo-abiodun-balogun-64b977186/), where i have to clean datasets and build interactive dashboards.

After reading about  **Data Wrangling** i discovered, i was cleaning my data the wrong way ðŸ˜«

Are you wondering how? ðŸ˜†

Well i was replacing **Missing Values** with **Zero** instead of using the **Mean or Average Value** so i was inspired to build a data cleaning app that will help me fill null values faster and easily. 

Learning is a way to make one's life easier and also make other's life easier too.

It looks like a simple project but it will go a long way with cleaning my datasets so i keep building amazing interactive dashboards ðŸ¥º That i always enjoy doing.
