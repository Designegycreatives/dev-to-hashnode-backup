## Introducing Myself

### This is my first blog post, üòä so let me introduce myself. 

My name is Anuoluwapo and I am a data scientist. 

Here is why I chose to be a data scientist; I found out I truly love solving problems to make others life better, this motivated me to develop the interests of solving problems with the help of data. 

### My journey into the Data world is really quite an interesting one, and I will share the journey with you. 

I started learning python programming in year 2019 and I started learning python programming for data analysis 2021 and I also did get certified as a data analyst early this year. 

### I am currently learning data engineering tools as well, this altogether makes me a self taught data scientist. 

My Data Science Tool Stacks are; 

Python Programming | R Programming | Power BI | Tableau | Excel | Rapid Miner Studio | MongoDB | Open Office Calc | Postgre SQL | Microsoft SQL Server 

Several platforms, websites and Blogs have contributed to my learning growths most especially YouTube. 

### Many of my data science project wouldn't have been successfully completed if I hadn't taken several lessons from YouTube. 

I have several blogs I would like to mention but i would love to talk about them as I continue to write more articles and reference such blogs and websites as I write my data science journals. 

### God has helped me thus far and I am grateful. 

I hope to write more articles relating to Data science, Data Analysis and Data Engineering. 

### Thank you for reading üôèüèΩ.
