## Correlation With Rapid Miner

**Sarah** is a regional sales manager for a nationwide supplier of fossil fuels for home heating.
Recent volatility in market prices for heating oil specifically, coupled with wide variability in the size of each order for home heating oil, has **Sarah** concerned.

She needs to understand what factors are related to heating oil usage, and how she might use the knowledge of such factors to better manage her inventory and anticipated demands.

**Correlation** is a statistical measure of how strong the relationships are between attributes in a dataset.

 The dataset consists of;

**Insulation**

**Temperature**

**Heating Oil**

**Number Of Occupants**

**Average Age**

**Home Size**

All correlation coefficients between 0 and 1 represents **Positive Correlations**

While all coefficients between 0 and -1 are** Negative Correlations**

There is a **positive correlation** with **Heating oil** and **Insulation Rating** which means as the demand of heating oil rises so will insulation rating and **vice versa**.

There is a **Negative Correlation**  between **Temperature** and **Insulation rating**.

Which means has temperature rises, insulation rating falls and vice versa.

**Conclusion**

The 2 most strongly correlated attributes in our data are; **Heating oil** and **Average Age**

Here are few actions **Sarah** can take in order to make her decisions

1. Dropping the Number Of occupants attribute
2. Investigate the role of home insulation
3. Adding greater granularity in the dataset
4. Adding additional attribute to the dataset
